# Feather

Feather is a lightweight, flexible, and highly extensible web framework for Rust, inspired by the simplicity and modularity of Express.js.

---

## Features

- **Middleware Support**: Chain and compose middleware functions effortlessly.
- **Route Handling**: Support for multiple HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.).
- **Lightweight**: Built using Rust’s high-performance and memory-safe features.
- **Thread-Safe**: Leverages Rust's thread safe aspects.

## Modules

- `middleware`: Contains the middleware trait and related functionality
- `response`: Defines the Response type used throughout the framework
- `sync`: Contains the main application and configuration structs

## Re-exports

The following items are re-exported for convenience:

- `AppConfig`: Configuration settings for the application
- `Middleware`: Trait for defining middleware
- `Response`: Type for HTTP responses
- `Request`: Type for HTTP requests
- `App`: The main application struct
- `Next`: Type alias for the next middleware function

---

## Installation

To get started with Feather, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
feather = "0.1.1"
```

## Quick Start

Here's an example of building a simple web server with Feather:

```rust,no_run
// Import dependencies from Feather
use feather::Response;
use feather::middleware::{Logger, MiddlewareResult};
use feather::{App, AppConfig};

// Main function - no async here!
// Create instance of AppConfig with 4 threads
let config = AppConfig { threads: 4 };

// Create a new instance of App
let mut app = App::new(config);

// Define a route for the root path
app.get("/", |_request: &mut _, response: &mut _| {
    *response = Response::ok("Hello from Feather!");
    MiddlewareResult::Next
});
// Use the Logger middleware for all routes
app.use_middleware(Logger);
// Listen on port 3000
app.listen("127.0.0.1:3000");
```

---

## Middleware

Feather supports middleware for pre-processing requests and post-processing responses, and you can make your own too! Here's an example:

```rust,no_run
// Import dependencies from Feather
use feather::Response;
use feather::{App, AppConfig, Request};
// Import the Middleware trait and some common middleware primitives
use feather::middleware::{Logger, Middleware, MiddlewareResult};

// Implementors of the Middleware trait are middleware that can be used in a Feather app.
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Custom;

// The Middleware trait defines a single method `handle`,
// which can mutate the request and response objects, then return a `MiddlewareResult`.
impl Middleware for Custom {
    fn handle(&self, request: &mut Request, _response: &mut Response) -> MiddlewareResult {
        // Do stuff here
        println!("Now running some custom middleware (struct Custom)!");
        println!("And there's a request with path: {:?}", request.url());
        // and then continue to the next middleware in the chain
        MiddlewareResult::Next
    }
}

// Define an app
let config = AppConfig { threads: 4 };
let mut app = App::new(config);

// Use the builtin Logger middleware for all routes
app.use_middleware(Logger);

// Use the Custom middleware for all routes
app.use_middleware(Custom);

// Use another middleware defined by a function for all routes
app.use_middleware(|_request: &mut Request, _response: &mut Response| {
    println!("Now running some custom middleware (closure)!");
    MiddlewareResult::Next
});

// Define a route
app.get("/", |_request: &mut _, response: &mut _| {
    *response = Response::ok("Hello from Feather!");
    MiddlewareResult::Next
});

// Listen on port 3000
app.listen("127.0.0.1:3000");
```

Built-in middleware includes:

- `Logger`: Logs incoming requests.
- `Cors`: Add cross-origin resource sharing headers to your response.

## Goals

- Be the simple & beginner-friendly web framework for Rust
- Be modular and expandable by design
- Be easy to use and learn

## Non-Goals

- Be the most powerful/performant web framework
- Use complex and low-level features
- Be the most feature-rich web framework
